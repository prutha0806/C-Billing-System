This program simulates a simple supermarket billing system. It allows users to input product codes and quantities, validates the codes, and calculates the total bill. The program uses global vectors to store product names, prices, and quantities, ensuring the data can be accessed across multiple functions. The `findPrice` and `productName` functions fetch product details based on the code, while the `generateBill` function displays a formatted bill with the product name, price, quantity, and total cost for each item, along with the grand total. It ensures a smooth user experience with clear prompts and error handling.
